Task 1: Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization
Objective

The objective of this task is to explore, analyze, and visualize the Iris dataset in order to understand its structure, patterns, and feature relationships. This task focuses on basic data analysis and visualization techniques commonly used in data science.

Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is a well known dataset that contains measurements of iris flowers.
It includes the following features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Species type

The dataset consists of three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python

Pandas for data handling

Seaborn for dataset loading and visualization

Matplotlib for plotting graphs

Steps Performed

Imported required Python libraries

Loaded the Iris dataset

Displayed dataset structure and summary statistics

Checked data types and missing values

Created visualizations including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots

Results and Observations

The dataset contains no missing values

Petal features show clear separation among species

Sepal features have some overlap between classes

Visualizations helped identify patterns and potential outliers

Conclusion

This task provided a clear understanding of the Iris dataset through exploratory data analysis and visualization. The results show that the dataset is clean and suitable for machine learning tasks. Visual analysis highlights that petal features are more effective than sepal features for distinguishing flower species.
